_A Sreenwriter's Tool_

This is [LPB25](https://www.kxsb.org/lpb25) hackathon project.

> The priority of this project is to avoid script content generation at all costs. 

## The Goal

To give screenwriters and film directors a productivity tool 
that optimizes routine operations and reduces communication overhead â€” 
similar to what modern [IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) tools do for software development.

## Key Ideas

A movie script is a well-structured text that:

1) have to comply with de-facto standards (e.g. Hollywood standard)
2) is used as a single source of truth to organise pre-production works (e.g. casting)

With a power of AI (LLM) a lot of routine operations with text can be done automatically. 
Especially this requires a full script text analysis or cross-checking (e.g. give me a list of film characters).

Lots of pre-production works:

are directly based on a script, and their content and communication can be streamlined 
by providing an accurate perspective (slice) of a script with an emphasis on e certain aspect.

This, of course, works in depth:

And potentially can be arranged with a support of a bidirectional feedback:

where:
1) changes made in a draft-# version of a script will automatically propagate (by email or push notification) to people working on derivatives (e.g. costumes)
2) if some ideas appear on later stage (e.g. [costume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_(fictional_species)#:~:text=The%20Predator%20was%20originally%20designed,weeks%2C%20ending%20in%20February%201987.)) it shall be possible to navigate back to the script and consistently incorporate it
