1. EXT. KINGSTON JAMAICA, KING STREET. MED LONG SHOT.
DAY
SHOOTING ALONG KING STREET.
Emerging from the pedestrian and traffic bustle, THREE
BLIND BEGGARS shuffle slowly forward toward DAMERA. They
are Chinese Negroes, bulky but bowed men tapping the
pavement tentatively with their white sticks. The FIRST
MAN, who wears sunglasses and is presumable not altogether sightless, walks in front holding a tin cup against
the crook of the stick in his left hand. The right hand
of the SECOND MAN rests on his shoulder, and the right
hand of the THIRD MAN on the shoulder of the SECOND. The
eyes of the SECOND and THIRD MEN are shut. They are
dressed in rags and wear dirty baseball caps with long
peaks.
As they approach the far side of the arch a WELL-DRESSED
PEDESTRIAN drops a coin into the FIRST MAN's cup.
FIRST BEGGAR
Bless you, Master.
2nd & 3rd BEGGARS
(mumbled chorus)
Bless you, Master.
They move forward. As they reach foreground SUPERIMPOSE

BEGGARS move out of the scene.

The THREE BEGGARS shuffling through varied Kingston
locales. Harbour Street, where they stop at a corner
until a PEDESTRIAN directs them across when the traffic
light changes: Victoria Market, past shops and booths:
a slum area, with brown-skinned GIRLS lounging in the
entrance of sleaxy bars. (ONE OF THEM drops a coin in
the cup.) Each scene has become increasingly darker as
the late afternoon wanes. As the TITLES END ...

FOUR MEN are playing bridge: JOHN STRANGWAYS, R.N. (ret.)
Caribbean Universal Exports Agent, or, less discreetly,
the local representative of the British Secret Service.
He is a tall, lean man with a black patch over his right
eye, and the sort of acquiline good looks associated with
the bridge of a destroyer; PLEYDELL-SMITH, the Colonial
Secretary, a youngish, shaggy-haired man with bright boyish eyes, enthusiastic and energetic; PROFESSOR DENT,
forty, distinguished-looking - a metallurgist by profession;
and POTTER, a recently-arrived business man from London.
STRANGWAYS

STRANGWAYS

The tapping of the sticks suddenly ceases. STRANGWAYS
turns partially back to the, the moment of silence
registering.

They have swivelled towards him. The BACK TWO fan out.
Three revolvers, ungainly with their silencers, are

black top hats.

SHOT. DUSK
MARY PRESCOTT, STRANGWAYS' secretary and No. 2, a strikinglooking young woman despite her tailored dress, is seated
at a powerful VHF ultra-short-wave radio which is disclosed in an alcove behind a sliding bookcase. She wears
a head-set with large foam rubber earpads. (About the
size of saucers.) This is necessary as the signal from
London in the absence of major amplifying equipment (very
bulky) will be fairly faint, so all local noise has to be
out to a minimum. Mesh mouthpiece attached plus, if
absolute accuracy is desirable, a "larynxapad" touching

her neck under her chin. A second, identical head-set lies
on a chair beside her ready for STRANGWAYS' use.
A safe is open beside her. There are the usual office
accoutrements; a desk, chairs, filing cabinets, typewriter table nearby, etc. The Venetian jalousies are
closed.

She has taken up second headphone and swivels in chair

From HER ANGLE, the big FIRST CHINESE NEGRO stands in the
doorway. He holds a gun on her (silencer fixed).
After a frozen moment MARY opens her mouth to scream, but
the MAN smiles broadly and, slowly measuring her with the
gun, shoots her three times in the chest.
As she slumps sideways to the floor the headphones slip
from her head and fall. For a second or so the tiny
chirrup of London calling sounds loud in the room. Then
it cuts off.
The CHINESE NEGRO looks down at MARY's body with satisfaction, then carefully blows the cordite fumes away from

the silencer (so they won't make his clothes smell)
before putting gun away.
He stands back, beckons to the OTHER TWO CHINESE NEGROES
to enter.
They move to MARY's body, pick it up and carry it out of
the room. There is a small pool of blood on the floor
where she lay.
The FIRST CHINESE NEGRO looks around, opens a couple of
drawers, checks their contents, sees a filing cabinet
against the wall, crosses to it, forces the lock skillfully
with a "Bateman Jemmy" ; the
cabinet springs open. He rifles quickly through files,
doesn't find what he is after at first - stoops and peers
at back of filing drawer - puts arm right in out of
sight - pulls out three or four files - checks through
lthem and finally selects two. We clearly see their
headings:
CRAB KEY
DOCTOR NO
The MAN shuts the cabinet again, glances round, hurres
out after OTHERS.

MESSAGE RUNNER a slip of paper.
1ST OPERATOR

He swivels back to his radio set. MESSAGE RUNNER crosses
past the rest of the operators to the near end of the
Communications Room. Behind a large cntrol console is
seated the FOREMAN OF SIGNALS. His station is separated

conversational hum characteristic of places where people
gamble for high stakes. Now and then a particularly
large or critical coup produces a momentary buzz of excitement.

30. INT. GAMING ROOM. TOP STAKES TABLE. MED. SHOT. NIGHT
The MAN holding the bank has his back to CAMERA, a large
stack of gambling chips in front of him. In direct contrast the stack in front of SYLVIA TRENCHARD has dwindled
to a very few. She is willowy, exquisitely gowned, with a
classic, deceptively cold beauty. At the moment the game
seems to have developed into a personal contest which the
CROUPIER and ONLOOKERS are watching with fascinated
interest.
SYLVIA
Carte.
The MAN slips her a card. looks across at her casually.
He examines his hand, draws another card, leaves it face
upwards. The CROUPIER turns over SYLVIA'S cards. She
has seven.
SYLVIA smiles confidently.
CROUPIER
Seven.
He turns over the man's cards. The man has an eight.
There is a murmur from the ONLOOKERS as the CROUPIER
racks the chips towards the MAN, whom we still have not
seen. BOND takes a cigarette from a flat gun-metal case
on the table beside him.
C8OUPIER
Bank of eight hundred.
There is another murmur from the ONLOOKERS.
Suivi.
SYLVIA

BOND hides his surpr is·e at her rapid follow-up - deals
their cards from the shoe. There is tense silence.
The CROUPIER turns their cards over. SYLVIA has a six -
BOND eight again. The CROUPIER rakes the chips towards
BOND. There are now only very few left in front of SYLVIA.
CROUPIER
Bank of sixteen hundred.
There is another murmur from the ONLOOOKERS. BOND looks
round the table for any takers. No-one moves.
SYLVIA

enigmatically)

BOND looks at her, frankly surprised this time. His eyes
drop to her small pile of chips.
SYLVIA
The house will cover the difference.

BOND glances at the CROUPIER, who nods almost imperceptibly.
Again BOND (whom we ahve still not seen front-view) deals.
SYLVIA
Carte.
BOND gives her another card. It is five. BOND's cards
are turned. He has two kings. He takes another. It is
a seven. The CROUPIER rakes the chips over to him again.
BOND deliberately breaks the tension by taking out his
cigarette case and offering it to SYLVIA.
BOND
I admire your courage, Miss .... ?
SYLVIA
(taking a cigarette)
Trench .... Sylvia Trench ...
He lights her cigarette.
SYLVIA
And I admire your luck, Mr .... ?

to his own cigarette, and
for the first time we
see his face)

Their eyes meet, appraisingly. Then a man comes up behind
BONDand bends down to whisper something. BOND listens
attentively, nods, rises.
BOND

Afraid I'll have to pass the shoe.
Andree
(to SYLVIA)
Forgive me ... an urgent matter.
He gets up - she gets up and joins him.
SYLVIA
(meaningly)
Too bad. Just as it was getting
interesting.
BOND
(amused by her obvious pass)
Do you play anything else but
Chemin de Fer?
SYLVIA
Golf occasionally.
BOND
How about a game tomorrow.
(slight pause)
and dinner afterwards?
SYLVIA
Its tempting. May I let you
know in the morning?
BOND
(taking a card from his pocket
and handking it to her)
Fine .... Here's my card .... give
me a call ...
He smiles, moves away. SYLVIA watches him go thoughtfully.

BOND
Anything to go on?
M.

Some blood on the floor by the
transmitter.
BOND
Was Strangways on something
important?
M.
Checking a query from the
Americans. They've been complaining
of massive interference with their
Cape Canaveral rockets •• and they
think it comes from the Jamaica
area. "Toppling" mean anything
to you?
BOND
A little. Throwing gyroscopic
controls of a missile off balance
with a radio beam or soemthing,
isn't it?
M.
{nodding)
More or less. Five million
dollars worth of missile aimed for
a spot in the South Atlantic, but
finishing in the middle of the
Brazilian jungle is bad enough •..

You'd better ask him. You're
booked on the seven o'clock plane
for Kingston.

I want to know what's happened to
Strangways.
There is a tap at the door and MAJOR BOOTHROYD enters.
He is a short, slim man with snady hair. He waits until
M. gestures him forward and then advances with a square
case which he puts on the table. BOND looks at it
gloomily.
M.
(to BOND)
Take off your jacket.
BOND hesitates the merest split second; then catching
M's very steady eye, obeys. We see that he is wearing
a shoulder holster.

You tell him •.. for the last time.
BOOTHROYD
(hefting it in his palm)
Nice and light ... in a lady's
handbag. No stopping power.
M.
Any comment, 007?
BOND
I don't agree sir. I've used the
Beretta for 10 years, and never
missed.
M.
Maybe not, but it jammed on your
last job, and you spend six months
in hospital in consequence. If
you carry a double O number you're
licences to kill - not get killed.
Another thing, since I've been head
of M.I.6 there's been a forty
percent drop in 00 operative casualties,
and I want to keep it that way - so
you'll carry the Walther,
(pause)
unless you's prefer to go back to
standard intelligence duties?
BOND

different gun.

BOND
No sir.

BOND frops his hand to his Walther, listens. Off scene
there is a slight clicking sound somewhere in the flat.
He scuffs off his soes, tip-toes slowly forward to the
bedroom door. He throws the bedroom door open suddenly
stepping back simultaneously into shelter of door-jam. He

the celluloid ball into the bowler hat which is lying on the
floor by foot of bed. It contains two or three balls while
otheres are on the floor around it, some half-hidden by
overhanging drapes of bed. As she straightens we have time
to notice that she is wearing nothing but a pair of BOND'S

to greet somebody, covering his face with it in a perfectly
natural gesture. As GIRL is winding frantically on he
moves to exit, smiling at her in passing.
40. EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING ENTRANCE. DAY.
a hefty CHINESE NEGRO CHAUFFEUR is standing beside an
official-looking limousine scanning the arriving passengers
as they emerge with their luggage. BOND, a PORTER behind
him pushing his luggage on a dolly, appears in background,
carrying his attache case. He comes towards CAMERA,
simultaneously hailing a cab with one or two chic
STEWARDESSES. He gallantly steps back for them. The cab
drives off with them. BOND looks around for another as the
UNIFORMED CHAUFFEUR approaches him.
CHAUFFEUR
Mistuh Bond, suh?
BOND
(good-humouredly. Smiling)
Yes. Who are you?
CHAUFFEUR

door.

Through the glass the CHAUFFEUR AND PORTER are visible in
the background putting the luggage into the boot of the open
car. We see the CHINESE GIRL PHOTOGRAPHER walk past them
slowly and apparently say something to the CHAUFFEUR. The
CHAUFFEUR membles something without looking up at her.
She walks on. this registers with BOND, but not too
obviously.
BOND

BOND comes out. CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM towards open car

and HOLDS as he reaches it. THE CHAUFFEUR is just closing the
boot. As BOND tips the PORTER a tall thin HATCHETFACED MAN (FELIX LEITER} emerges from airport building
in background. He is obviously interested in BOND. The
CHAUFFEUR opens the door of the car. BOND pauses before
entering.
CHAUFFEUR
Where to, sir?
BOND
Government house - but I'm not
in a hurry ..• Suppose you just ...
take me for a ride.

Always drive this fast? I said
I wasn't in a hurry.
CHAUFFEUR
Sorry, suh ... but I think dey's
some feller follo'ing us.
BOND turns slightly and squints back through rear window.
BOND
All right ... try and lose them.
The CHAUFFEUR increases xpeed, narrowly missing local
bus labelled "BROWNSKIN GAL", scattering three laden
donkeys and two fat, bandana-ed market women driving
them.
53. EXT. ROAD. OPEN CAR. TRAVEL HOT. DAY.
The foliage on either side of the road is growing denser.

58. INT. OPEN CAR. BOND AND CHAUFFEUR. DAY.
As the found of the other car recedes in distance. the
CHAUFFEUR listens for a second, then, in CLOSE-UP we see
his profile suddenly stiffen, panic and amazement corning
into his expression.
CAMERA EASES BACK a few inches to reveal the muzzle of
the Walther gently stroking, almost tickling sopt just
below and to rear of CHAUFFEUR's left ear.
BOND (voice)
(softly almost caressingly)
Now, Mistuh Jones .... Talk fast
before your pal doubles back. Who
are you working for?
CHAUFFEUR
(frozen ... licking lips)
I .... I don' know what your's
talking about. I was just sent to
meet you at the ~irport.

BOND
(very softly)
Ah, but by whom?
CHAUFFEUR
By ..•..... Government House.
BOND
I don't think so.
26.
He leans forward carefully and taps CHAUFFEUR'S pockets and
under his left armpit, still with gun in other's neck. He seems
satisfied. The CHAUFFEUR'S left hand has dropped, hidden by
back of driving seat.
BOND (Contd.)
Both hands on the wheel, Mistuh
Jones. I'm a nurvous passenger.
The CHAUFFEUR complies.
BOND (Contd . )
Now get out ... move. And keep your hands where
I can see them.
As the CHAUFFEUR feels the gun being removed from his neck, he
slides slowly across the seat, keeping his hands high
above the fascia, still being covered by BOND, who starts
to open door. The door is flung open, then as the
CHAUFFEUR starts to get slowly out, one of his hands
drops to glove compartment, hitting spring catch of
lid. As lid drops open, BOND hits CHAUFFEUR'S hand
heavily wiht muzzle of pistol. BOND leans forward
calmly and takes a flat .38 Browing from glovebox.
59. EXT. OPEN CAR. DAY.
The next minute he is out of the car. He drops second
gun into his side pocket, slips his own into waistband
of trousers, reaches in and pulls CHAUFFEUR out by scruff
of neck. He jerks him hard up against car. The CHAUFFEUR
tries to bring his knee up into BOND's crutch, at the same
time jabbing for his eyes with fingers in V-sign. BOND
chops him across adam's apple with edge of palm. The
CHAUFFEUR drops, gurgling.
BOND
(unfeelingly)
Get up.
27.
59. Continued.
The CHAUFFEUR struggles to his feet, panting and gasping.
The sound of LEITER'S car comes to them, returning. Instinctively BOND glances towards the road. The CHAUFFEUR
jumps him. this is his intention, but instead he continues
on his way over BOND'S head helped by a hamihada (right
hand takes right wrist of victim, left hand takes him
behind elbow, BOND drops slightly and applies leverage
to victim's right arm. Victim's forward rush supplies
necessary momentum). The CHAUFFEUR lands on his head.
Like a flash BOND picks him up and spins him back against
car, then measuring him off, belts him sideways round car
out of SHOT.
60. EXT. ROAD. FULL SHOT. DAY.
LEITER'S car passes the break in the foliage, and rroves
out of scene.
61. EXT. OPEN CAR. DAY (RESUME 59)
We see only BOND'S uppper body, rest being hidden by bonnet
of car. He stares after the departing car, then turns
and looks down at unseen CHAUFFEUR. He stoops. There is
a moan.
CHAUFFEUR (voice)
Al right ..... all right .... I'll talk.
BOND
(grimly)
On your feet.
He hauls him up by collar. CAMERA ANGLES ROUND to take
in their entire bodies. The CHAUFFEUR wipes blood from
his face with cuff. BOND fastidiously takes his own
handkerchief from breast pocket, balls it in his hand and
throws it at the other. The CHAUFFEUR mops his face, then
fumbles for his breast pocket.
BOND
(sharply)
Hold it! .
CHAUFFEUR
(mumbling)
Lernme ...• lemme .... have a cig-rette •..

BOND
(he checks that there is only
a packet of cigarettes in
breast pocket, pulls them out
and gives-them to him)
Come on •.. I haven't got all day.
Who's paying you, ... and for what?
The CHAUFFEUR appears to be having some difficulty in
focussing on packet. He fumbles •.. then finally selects
a cigarette. BOND, to save time, has impatiently produced
his own lighter, and holds it poised.
CHAUFFEUR
(still mumbling)
Well •.• it's like this ...
He puts cigarette right into mouth and bites hard. There
is a glass-like crunch. BOND registers immediately and
jumps forward, but it is too late. The CHAUFFEUR'S face
contorts horribly.
CHAUFFEUR
(strangled shriek, in act of
falling)
The ...• hell with you ...•
He spits out mangled paper, tobacco and glass.

BOND stands looking down at him as he gives last convulsive
twitch. He slowly wipes a modicum of something nasty from
his cheek. He stoops and picks something up carefully
with a handkerchief.

Out of the chewed mass protrudes the shattered end of a
glass ampoule, surrounded by ;the handkerchief.

outside, gets out, dusts himself off. A UNIFORMED GUARD
comes forward.
BOND

The door opens and DUFF, the Jamaican Police Commissioner,
enters. he is well-build, middle-aged, reliable looking.
He is shaking contents of handkerchief into big official
envelope. He puts the handkerchief in as well.
PLEYDELL-SMITH
Well, Duff .... ?
DUFF
The car was stolen ..• and we
haven't yet been able to identify
the driver. He certainly wasn't
a Kingston man.
BOND

Wherever he was from, the news of
my arrival leaked.

PLEYDELL-SMITH
Well, we didn't advertise it, I can
assure you.
BOND

I got the impression someone had been
selling tickets.
DUFF
Anything more we can do for you?
BOND
Yes, I'd like to meet the last people
to see Strangways.
PLEYDELL-SMITH
Well, nobody seems to have seen him

That's her blood type.
DUFF crosses to filing cabinet.
DUFF
(points to drawer)
Expertly jemmied. Looks as if the
fellow knew what he was after ...
and where to find it.
BOND quickly riffles through files ... glancing and
discarding. He eventually comes to empty hidden compartment at back. He crosses to radio. He examines
dials.
DUFF
The set was still switched on when
we came round. We tried to get
through on the same frequency but it
was dead the other end.
BOND
(drily)
And will stay dead. All frequencies
are changed immediately security is
broken.
He wanders round examining everything, open drawers,
riffling through contents. He notices a book with a
folded paper serving as bookmark. He picks it up, opens
it and glances at contents, then unfold paper and looks
at it.

BOND shrugs and slips paper into pocket. Continuing to
poke round he sees a Press photo secured by thumb tacks
to side of bookcase. CAMERA MOVES IN over shoulders of
both of them as BOND studies it. We can see STRANGWAYS
and Leiter's JAMAICAN DRIVER standing beside a boat
proudly posing with an enormous sail-fish, deep-sea rods,
etc.
BOND
(quickly)
Who's the man with Strangways?
DUFF
(studying photo)
Oh, one of the local fishermen.
BOND
He was driving the car that tailed
me from the airport.
DUFF
(eyes narrowing)
That so? That's something to
start on. I'll have a thorough
check made on him ...

BOND, standing in front of mirror, is putting finishing
touches to tie. He is in shirt-sleeves, and a tropical

JAMAICAN WAITER putting gin, glass, ice, tonic and fresh
lime on tray on low table.

No, that will be all, thanks.

BOND waits until the door closes, then he crosses to it

and softly turns the key.· He returns to an open suitcase
on luggage stool, feels under clothes in it and takes out
his Walther in shoulder holster. He adjusts straps over
his shoulders and then puts on jacket, pats into final
adjustment and checks in mirror. He then closes suitcase,
locks it and goes to bathroom. He returns with tin of
talcum powder. He sprinkles a microscopic amount of powder
on catches of case and carefully blows off surplus. He
returns to dressing table, carefully pulls a hair from his
head and delicately places it between tow folded shirts.
Closes drawer, takes final look round, crosses to door,
opens it, switches off light and leaves.
During this action, but in no way to impede the smooth
flow ot it, he has poured and drunk appreciatively a long
gins-ling. what he has done must be manifestly a normal,
automatic drill.

POTTER
Personally I never heard him talk
about anything but bridge and big
game fishing.
PLEYDELL-SMITH
Fishing was his latest craze.
He got the bug a few weeks ago

every day since.
POTTER
Must have cost him something.
These fishermen charge the earth

The scene is peaceful, boats rock gently on the water in
time to calypso music which comes from some waterfront
cafe. BAND comes down the quay, stops to ask an old
FISHERMAN the way. The FISHERMAN points to where QUARREL
is working in his boat, whistling the calypso tune. BOND
walks up to him. As his shadow falls across QUARREL,
the latter stops whistling and lo~ks up slowly.
BOND

QUARREL

Okay, mister. Suppose you
start de conversation?
He draws a wicked looking flick-knife and shoots £lade,
fingers it thoughtfully. BOND's right hand shoots for
gun under arm, but before he can reach it PUS-FELLER,
who has followed them silently, has pinioned his arms
from behind.
QUARREL

Ain't no use struggling.
Pus-Feller wrestles alligators .••

BOND has kicked the knife flying and overshot with same
kick into QUARREL'S belly. Simultaneously he has thrown
PUS-FELLER clean over his head by reverse flying-mare
(both his hands up and back round the back of victim's
head until fingers interlock. He drops to a crouch
and heaves. His shoulders are the fulcrom). PUS-FELLER
flies through a complete parabola, crashing into QUARREL
as he is making a quick comeback. BOND has. now got gun
on them -- cammands stance -- legs planted firmly apart
wrist of gun hand pressed firmly into his own navel -- forward crouch over it. He inches backwards to door,
free hand feeling for knob behind him.

shoves a Walther into his kidneys.

LEITER

Gently, bud, gently. Let's not

BOND stiffens. His position is now untenable and he's
not a bloody fool. LEITER stretches round in front of
him and takes his gun. He looks at two identical weapons
with slightly raised eyebrows.
LEITER
(to QUARREL)
Frisk this guy.
QUARREL looking murderous, steps forward and expertly
frisks BOND. (Expertly means to start at sock level
and rub and tap lightly upwards. A favourite place for
keeping a second gun or a knife is taped to the inside of
the thigh. QUARREL evidently knows this.)
LEITER

BOND CLEARLY)
Interesting. Where were you
measured for this, bud?
BOND

LEITER
That so? Mine's a guy in Washington.

puts his own gun into his shoulder
holster, reverses one in his left
hand and holds it butt first to
BOND, simultaneously holding out
now free right hand in greeting)
Felix Leiter, C.I.A. You must be
James Bond.
BOND

You mean, we're fighting the same

The CHINESE GIRL from the airport is unscrewing the flash
bulb, replacing it with another, as she innocently turns
away. She is dressed in a tight black satis cheongsam.
But has a Leica with flash attachment in one hand.

Get her, Quarrel ... and her camera.
QUARREL glides across to where the GIRL has just raised

Suddenly the GIRL's hand flies up to QUARREL'S face. There
is a sharp explosion. BOND snatches at her free airm and
drags it back. Blood streams down QUARREL'S face. A

is not fool enough to leave anything of importance- in an
hotel bedroom, but it does tell him that somebody has
been "turning him over".in his absence. He goes to gin on
centre table, picks up bottle and shakes it -- examines
it -- smells it -- but takes no chances. He takes a fresh
bottle from side table, examines seal, opens it and pours

terror. His neck muscles stiffen. His eyes travel down.
CAMERA PULLS BACK to take in his form under sheet. From
reg ion of his ankle we see the shape of something on his -leg

starts slowly to travel up his leg. BOND is.frozen with
horror. The thing continues -- stops -- moves. on. It
gets to the region of his crutch. BOND does not like it

The telephone rings in her bedroom. She is still trying to
puzzle the situation out •.. staring at him. She makes no
movement.
BOND

You'd better answer it.
She turns away to bedroom, goes in, pushing the door shut

some idea he would like to put into practice.
MISS TARO

It's very beautiful.

Thank you.
BOND lifts it up, looks at her critically.
BOND
(Casually)
Every wear it up?
MISS TARO
(flattered by his interest)
Sometimes.
BOND
With a face like yours, it must
look wonderful.
MISS TARO
(interested)
You think so?
She crosses to the mirror, stands in front of it, looking
at herself critically, then raises her arms to put her
hair up. The inevitable, which BOND has been hoping for,
happens - the bathtowel round her body slips downwards.
Her back is towards BOND, but he can see the considerable
maximum in the mirror ..• as she clutches at the falling
towel he moves towards her and takes her in his arms.

129. INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
BOND is lying in bed, sheet covering lower part of bare
torso, watching MISS TARO do her nails in front of the mirror.
She is waring a scanty kimono. He stretches lazily
and gets a cigarette from his coat on the back of the chair
beside the bed. We catch the merest glimpse of his shoulder
holster hanging beneath it.
BOND
I'm hunry. Lets go out and eat.
MISS TARO

BOND comes up behind her at the mirror. His hands come down

sits up and sniffs.
QUARREL

Gettin's close now, cap'n.
BOND
Right, better drop the sail - in
case their radar is on scan.
They drop the sail and continue paddling. We hear growing
sound of distant surf on reef.
140. EXT. SEA. ANOTHER PART
BOND and QUARREL battle hard against the chop. The canoe
is not as light under paddle as sail. Sweat runs .down
BOND's face. QUARREL paddles comparatively easily and
very expertly. We see whiteness of surf on coral and
noise comes up louder. The canoe enters the choppy
water. They paddle desperately. The channel is dark
against white spray.
QUARREL

Now, capn ••• NOW! Hard round!
The canoe, under their concerted efforts, swings into
calmer water of lagoon. They rest for a second ••• gasping
and panting ••. and look at Crab Key.

141. EXT. CRAB KEY. NIGHT.
It stands dark and sinister against the night sky. There
is a broad beach, bounded on one side by a river.
Behind the beach the island rises in a borbidding mass of
rocky mountain. The quay is on the other side of the island
out of sight.
142. EXT. CONOE. NIGHT
BOND and QUARREL start to paddle cautiously towards the
beach. There is a rise of water as the canoe noses
through the surf backwash and a series of grating bumps
QUARREL steers towards a rocky promontoary.
143. EXT. CRAB KEY. BEACH. NIGHT
QUARREL grounds the canoe and they jump ashore. BOND
stoops and picks up a handful of pink coral sand.
QUARREL throws three lengths of thick "male" bamboo out
of boat. They heave the nose up on the first length and
push it onto the others •.. then go through manoeuvre of
running it up on rollers •.. BOND taking last one and
bringing it round to the front as they progress.
144. EXT. CRAB KEY. ANOTHER PART. NIGHT.
~ They push the canoe into the rocks, grass and bushes at
the end of the beach, and camouflage it with dried seaweed and driftwood. BOND looks at his watch and then at
the sky.
BOND

We'd better get some rest before
it's light.
BOND takes a short bushy branch and starts carefully to
sweep over and cover their foot and canoe marks in the
sand. QUARREL surreptitously extracts his jar from the
canoe and retires among the boulders. BOND completes
task down to waterline, then skips from tock to rock
back again. H takes Walter from holster, eases back
jacket, and applies safety catch, replaces it. He
scoops a slight depression in sand, heaves out a few
hermit crabs, then lies full length, pillowing head
on arm.

145. THE SAME. NEXT MORNING. DAY.
The sun beats down on BOND as he sleeps. In the distance, as
if in his dreams, he can hear a WOMAN SINGING. Slowly,
his eyes open and for a few minutes we see him trying to get
thinks into focus. Then, as if conscious of the
sounds around him, he straightens up. Then, slowly and
carefully, he snakes forw~rd and peers through the screening
grasses. His expression registeres sheer unbelief.
146. BOND'S EYEELINE. DAY.
What he sees: HONEY, standing at the water's edge, her
back to him. She i~ naked except for a wisp os home-made
bikini and a broad leather belt with an undersea knife
in a sheath. (Undersea knife differs from a conventional
hunting one in that it has a rather bulky cork handle which
causes it slowly to surface fi droppped underwater. This is rather
important as they are characteristic.) Her
ash-blonde hai~ hangs to her shoulders, a little wet and
bedraggled. Her skin is deep honey cooured. A diving
mask is pushed up onto her forehead. At her feet lies
a heap of small pink shells. A little further along
the beach a small canoe with furled sail is pulled up on
the sand, drawn behind some rocks. The GIRL puts down a
shell, picks up another and starts to examine it carefully ...
singing softly. She stretches contentedly like a cat
in the warm sun.

From its position it is obvious that BOND, QUARREL AND
HONEY are in fact the other side of it and in the
danger area, having approached from the other direction.
The HUNTERS start to retreat, whipping-in the DOGS and
hauling them off the trail. The DOGS, naturally unaware
of danger, are frantically trying to break forward towards the
reeds. The HUNTERS are equally frantic in hauling and
whipping them off downstream parallel to, but at a
respectful distance from the fence. They look at it
apprehensively as they move.
170. EXT. JUNGLE RIVER. DAY
We are close up on three reeds as first BOND, then HONEY

as they listen to sounds of retreating hunters. Satisfied, he motions for them to follow him quietly. They
move forward, and in doing so BOND sees the wire and
notice for the first time. From his expression, we realise
that he is now aware that they've been on the wrong side
of it. There is, however, nothing he can do about it.
They push on, wading waist deep.

177. EYELINE SHOT
From BOND's angle, several h-ndred yards away, a black
shapeless thing is moving through the mangroves. As it
comes closer, two glaring·eyes with black pupils become
clear. Between the eyes, where the mouth might be, a
yard of blue flame flickers. As it approaches, the blue
flame shoots out arid illuminates -it for a moment. It is

197. INT. DECONTAMINATION CENTRE. NIGHT.
The large, electrically operated doors of the decontamination
centre rise slowly, and outside them we see the dragon
standing. BOND AND HONEY are brought round from the back
by the TWO GUARDS and hustled under the doors, where two
OPERATIVES, also in decontamination suits, meet them.
The GUARDS leave. Behind them the doors close slowly.
Inside, the centre is all white glazed tiles, and running
the full length of the room is a narrow automatic treadmill,
built on the lines of an automatic car washer, in which
various washing devices, brushes, water and detergent
sprays are installed at intervals. In front of it is a
shoulder-high translucent wall and on the back wall are a
series of marked dials, corresponding to various archlike check points along the treadmill, on which the degree
of radio-activity of the subject is shown.
While BOND AND HONEY still stand just inside the door
the TWO OPERATIVES approach the, carrying a couple of hoses
with wide-angle nozzles, which they direct on BOND AND
HONEY, drenching them from head to foot with the strong
jets. Then the hoses are turned off and they are
motioned toweards the beginning of the treadmill. One of
the OPERATIVES speaks, into a small built-in microphone
attached to his head-piece.
OPERATIVE
(pointing to treadmill
opening)
Take off your clothes and go in
there.
His VOICE comes back, distorted through a loud-speaker
attached to the wall. BOND AND HONEY look startled. He
glances round, comes to a decision.
BOND
(to HONEY)
All right •.• Do as they say •.•
HONEY steps behind the glass screen and starts to undress,
while another OPERATIVE goes up to BOND and unlocks his
handcuffs.
103.
197. Continued
HONEY's clothes come piece by piece over the glass
screen. As they come, an OPERATIVE picks them up with
the aid of long slave-tongs, and carries them away to
what appears to be an incinerator shoot on the other
side of the centre.
HONEY moves along the treadmill. We see her figure
vaguely outlined through the glass. An OPERATIVE Motions
to BOND to follow here. He does so, removing his clothes
as she did. They too are carefully carried away.
There is the swish of water as the showers above and to
either side of the treadmill are switched on.
OPERATIVE
Under the showers, please .••
BOND AND HONEY move slowly along going through all the
various processes of decontamination - sprayed with
detergent, rubbed down with various kinds fo brushes,
automatic and wielded by ATTENDANTS - still in decontamination kit.
As they start to move up the treadmill, the first dial
registers rights past the "danger" mark ••• as they
move progressively further, getting progressively cleaner,
the dial register drops accordingly. At the far end of the
treadmill the jets of water are replaced by jets of
air, blowing their hair about wildly and they are fried,
and finally when they emerge from the other end of the
treadmill, the dial reading marks "Normal Radiation".
TOW CHINESE ATTENDANTS, this time in towelling robes,
approach them arid lead them towards a geiger counter
fitting. The reading, as BOND steps on to it, is
negative. The ATTENDANT signs to him to put his hands
into it. BOND does so. There is an immediate increase
in the clicking. The ATTENDANT takes a pair of scissors
attached to her belt by a chain, and trims his nails
quickly and skillfully, then indicates to him to put his
hands near machine again. He does so. This time the
reading is nagative. She hands him a kimono and motion
him towards a heavy door in the wall.
He turns towards HONEY who is being helped into a
kimono. She draws it across her hastily to cover her
nakedness.

The room is high-ceilinged, about sixty feet ling, combining the elements of a study and library, but with

A flurry of movement the other side of the glass catches
BONDS eye. He swings round quickly. As he walks towards
it we see that the wall is, in fact, a huge pane of plate
glass, behind which fish are swimming. A big grouper with
goggling eyes gazes in, then whisks away. A silver swarm
of anchovies speeds past. The twenty-foot tendrils of
Portuguese men-o'-war drift slowly across; a big tulip
shell is crawling up the window; angel fish are rubbing
themselves against the glass.

This is an alcove off the living room, opposite which
the aquarium wall glows distantly beyond the fainter
lights of candles. Dinner has reached the cheese,
fruit and nuts stage. In front of BOND is a cheese
board with a serrated-edge knife balanced on it.
BOND is helping himself as the scene starts.
DR. NO
I was the unwanted child of a
German missionary and a Chinese
girl of good family, but I
became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.

It's rare for the Tongs to trust
anyone who isn't wholly Chinese.
DR. NO
They shouldn't have trusted me.
I came to America with ten million

HONEY cries out with fear and struggles ineffectively
in the guard's arms as she is draffed from her chair
and over to the door. BOND jumps to his feet, reaching
out for a champagne bottle to use as a weapon, but as
his hand tightens round it his airms are sized from
behind by another guard.
DR. NO
That's a Dom Perignon '55. It
would be a pity to break it.
BOND slinks slowly back to his chair, pulls himself
together, puts the bottle back carefully onihe table.
He glances at the label.
BOND

In one of his artificial hands he picks up a small metal

207. INT. A SMALL CELL.
It is bare except for a plank bed fastened to one wall, and
windowless except for a fairly large grilled ventilator under
the ceiling above the bed.
BOND is crumpled up on tQe floor. He is in a hell of a
state and has obviously been put through the mill. After
a few moments he starts to move. He gets painfully to his
hands and knees, then finally to his feet. He staggers to
the door, and finds that it is handleless. He weaves round
the cell examining the walls, then finally turns his attention
to the ventilator. It is just possible to reach it by standing on the bed. As his fingers come into contact with it,
there is a blue flash and he is hurled accross the cell. The
light jumps and dims. He recovers and goes back to it. He
sees the end of a small piece of flex smouldering. He
touches it warily. No reaction. The current is fused. He
pulls on the flex and shoves it to one side. Tests the
grille again. He manages to shake it loose and pull it
down .•. then he hauls himself up into it.

it.

Faint light from somewhere at the bottom of the shaft
makes it possible to see how deep it is, and how smooth.
211. INT. SHAFT.
BOND runs his fingers over surfact to seek for hand and
footholds. There are occasional bumps where tubes are
welded. He hesitates for a moment and then drops his
legs into hole, gets tenuous hold with his feet, slides
shoulders into position, starts going down like a
potholder----hands, feet, shoulders----hands, feet,
shoulders.

deeply, getting back his nerve. Then he starts to go down
again.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
BOND, seen from bottom of shaft, looking up from another
tunnel. He is about twelve feet from the bottom. We see
his feet feeling for a hold, slipping. He recovers ... inches
down ••• slips again. This time he cannot stop himself and
goes the whole way, to land in a heap at the fcot of the
shaft. He lies where he has fallen for a moment, then
slowly sits up and rubs his ankle.
QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
BOND, crawling along another horizontal shaft. He is
covered with sweat, shirt soaking. Every couple of feet he
has to wipe his eyes and push his hair away. He is panting
painfully. He reaches a corner, rounds it. At the far end
there seems to be a light. He starts forward again, draws
back back quickly, sucking his fingers. He tears a piece
of cloth from his shirt and throws it forward. As he watches
it, it turns brown and starts to smoulder. His shoulders sag.
QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
BOND in same position. He has torn his shirt into strips,
and is just finishing binding them round hands and feet. Then
he pulls himself forward into heated tube. After a few
feet the rags on his hands start to smoulder. From other end
of tube, BOND crawling towards CAMERA. The rags round hands
and feet are smouldering heavily. He lurches and nearly
collapses, then forces himself onwards. Suddenly there is
a roaring sound and a rush of water comes tearing down
towards him. He looks up, sees it coming, and with a last
conscious effort braces himself to meet it. The water surges
over him and races on down the tunnel, hisses as it cools
the overheated plates. In a moment it has passed, but
BOND doesn't move.
DISSOLVE TO:
212. Continued
BOND in the same position. The shaft is heating up again.
What remains of his clothing has dried. He stirs, moves,
groans. Then he opens his eyes. He considers for a
moment, then fumbles for the jade lighter in trouser
pockets. He flicks it on and watches flame. He takes
direction away from the main source of air.

BOND, with difficulty, pushes it aside, continuing to
hold onto metal so it doesn't fall and make a noise.
He clambers out of the shaft, drops down to floor. He
is almost completely spent. He leans back against wall,
fighting for air in his tortured lungs. He glances round,
taking in the equipment, the metal cupboards lining the
room. He moves silently to the door, opens it carefully,
glancing out. A low hum and bleeping sound comes to his
ears. He looks worried by what he sees, shuts the door

occasional brief, muted word from THREE OR FOUR OPERATORS
at the control consoles, who study dials and make adjustments. Over everything is a subdued hum of electric
generators. Over that again, an air of tense, concentrated
expectancy. Everybody is concentrating on his own job, but

"Danger level 25. Do not insert beyond this point." A
large circular dial, calibrated 0-50, reads zero. There
is a red line at 25 with the word "Danger" above it. An
idea dawns on BOND's face as he gingerly feels the handwheels controlling the elements, and sees a slight movement of the dial's pointer as he does so. He is startled
by the hand of a TECHNICIAN on his shoulder. He steels
himself and reacts casually.
