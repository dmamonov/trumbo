As 
the 
CHAUFFEUR 
feels 
the

being 
removed 
from

he 
slides 
slowly 
across

The

The

BOND 
AND 
HONEY 
are 
brought 
round 
from 
the 
back 
by 
the 
TWO 
GUARDS 
and 
hustled 
under 
the 
doors, 
where 
two 
OPERATIVES, 
also 
in 
decontamination 
suits, 
meet 
them. 
The 
GUARDS 
leave. 
Behind 
them 
the 
doors 
close 
slowly. 
Inside, 
the

is 
all 
white 
glazed 
tiles, 
and 
running 
the 
full 
length

the 
room 
is 
a 
narrow 
automatic 
treadmill, 
built 
on 
the 
lines 
of 
an 
automatic 
car 
washer, 
in 
which 
various 
washing 
devices, 
brushes, 
water 
and 
detergent 
sprays 
are 
installed 
at 
intervals. 
In 
front 
of 
it 
is 
a 
shoulder-high 
translucent 
wall 
and 
on 
the 
back 
wall 
are 
a 
series 
of 
marked 
dials, 
corresponding 
to 
various 
arch-
like 
check 
points 
along 
the 
treadmill, 
on 
which 
the 
degree 
of 
radio-activity 
of 
the 
subject 
is 
shown. 
While 
BOND 
AND 
HONEY 
still 
stand 
just 
inside 
the 
door 
the 
TWO 
OPERATIVES 
approach 
the, 
carrying 
a 
couple 
of 
hoses 
with 
wide-angle 
nozzles, 
which 
they 
direct 
on 
BOND 
AND 
HONEY, 
drenching 
them 
from 
head 
to 
foot 
with 
the 
strong 
jets. 
Then 
the 
hoses 
are 
turned 
off 
and 
they 
are 
motioned 
toweards 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
treadmill. 
One 
of 
the 
OPERATIVES 
speaks, 
into 
a 
small 
built-in 
microphone 
attached 
to 
his 
head-piece.

His 
VOICE 
comes 
back, 
distorted 
through 
a 
loud-speaker 
attached 
to 
the

BOND

up

the

long

the

jets
