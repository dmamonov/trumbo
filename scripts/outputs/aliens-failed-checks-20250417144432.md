# Failed Checks for *ALIENS*

## Boring Scene

- **Text snippet:** `Ripley sits at a table in the dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from her cigarette. The place is modest, to be charitable, and there are few personal touches. Though it's late in the day Ripley is still wearing a robe. The bed is unmade. Dishes in the sink. Jones prowls across the counter. The WALLSCREEN is on, blaring vapidly.`

  - **Issue:** This scene lacks tension and excitement, making it feel drawn out and unengaging compared to the rest of the screenplay.

## Burke'S Explanation

- **Text snippet:** `BURKE                     All right. My instinct says                     you're strong enough to handle                     this...Fifty-seven years.`

  - **Issue:** Burke explains the situation to Ripley in a way that tells rather than shows, which detracts from the dramatic tension of the scene.

## Burke'S Intentions

- **Text snippet:** `BURKE                     I know, I know, but we're dealing                     with changing scenarios here.`

## Camera Operation On The Drop-Ship

- **Text snippet:** `INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     40 Ripley, wearing a flight jacket and headset, files into the ship with the hulking troopers. Inside they pass directly into the APC we saw loaded earlier and take seats facing each other across a narrow aisle. They will drop already strapped into their ground vehicle for rapid deployment. A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling depressurization of the cargo lock.`

  - **Issue:** The screenplay includes direct references to camera operations, which should not be present in a screenplay. Instead, the focus should be on the actions and dialogue of the characters without mentioning how the camera captures these moments.

## Narration In The Opening Scene

- **Text snippet:** `Silent and endless. The stars shine like the love of God...cold and remote.`

  - **Issue:** The opening scene contains direct narration that describes the stars shining like the love of God, which is a form of telling rather than showing.

## Ripley'S Determination

- **Text snippet:** `RIPLEY                     I want those specimens destroyed                     as soon as you're done with them.`

## Ripley'S Realization

- **Text snippet:** `RIPLEY                     I promised her I'd be home for                     her birthday. Her eleventh                     birthday. I sure missed that                     one.`

  - **Issue:** Ripley directly states her feelings about her daughter and the time lost, which could be shown through her actions or expressions instead.
