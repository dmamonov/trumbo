# Failed Checks for *A CUP OF COFFEE*

## Awkward Coffee Shop Conversation

- **Text snippet:** `A rugged hand picks up a spoon and stirs his coffee with it. He takes the coffee and gently sips. This is MARK, 43, and with a tough exterior but as cool as John Wayne. Across from him sits a fidgety man. AARON DECK. Aaron looks down at his coffee. A creamy brown. He looks back up at Mark. AARON So, how’s Susan? MARK Good. She finally opened her haberdasher. So, she’s enthralled. AARON That was always her dream. Mark bleakly smiles. Awkwardness is thick in the air.`

  - **Issue:** The scene is overly drawn out with unnecessary small talk that doesn't contribute to character development or plot progression, making it feel tedious and boring.

## Coffee Shop Confrontation

- **Text snippet:** `INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY A rugged hand picks up a spoon and stirs his coffee with it. He takes the coffee and gently sips. This is MARK, 43, and with a tough exterior but as cool as John Wayne. Across from him sits a fidgety man. AARON DECK. Aaron looks down at his coffee. A creamy brown. He looks back up at Mark. AARON So, how’s Susan? MARK Good. She finally opened her haberdasher. So, she’s enthralled. AARON That was always her dream. Mark bleakly smiles. Awkwardness is thick in the air. MARK How’s your dog. What’s his name? Buster. AARON Yeah. Buster. He died. MARK That’s sad. Mark starts to wander, trying to avoid this casual talk. MARK Look, I’ll cut right to the chase. Susan doesn’t want you involved in Beth and Derek’s life anymore. Aaron doesn’t look too surprised. But he rebuts: AARON She can’t cut me out like that. Court says I have visitations. MARK She’s gonna put up a case for the judge. Now, it’s better to just cut your loses and focus on picking up you’re life. When the kids become legal adults and if they decide they want to see you, you can. (MORE) I’m sorry we have to do this but it’s best. AARON Can I ask a question? MARK Ok. AARON What in the world did I do? Mark looks absolutely shocked and disgusted. AARON (CONT’D) Ok, yes, I did drink way too much at that party but I am back to my AA meetings and my therapist says I am making real progress. I am on the way to recover and...and kicking me out of my kids lives will just kill me. I wouldn’t be able to take it. Please just convince her to reconsider. MARK I did, Aaron. I did eighteen months ago when you showed up drunk to Derek’s cello recital. I talked her out of it when you wrecked her van because you were sauced at 3 in the afternoon. I made her reconsider you many times and you blew each one. She’s done with you. I’M done with you. Our decision is final. Aaron gets teary. AARON It’s just been hard. MARK Don’t do this sympathy shit. I KNOW it’s been hard since your son died. And if anyone else knows it its Susan and Derek and Beth. They had to deal with it too. But your answer to the problem was Alcohol and it eat away until you had nothing. Mark starts to get up. 2. (CONT'D) MARK (CONT’D) Goodbye Aaron. You will receive a call from our lawyer giving the finite details. Mark starts to leave. We leave a shot on Aaron’s face as he is nearly in tears. He sorta gets himself together. He pulls out of his pocket is a six cylinder gun. He barely smiles and then.... BANG! Mark turns around to find AARON’S BODY collapsed on the floor. His head BLASTED open from the gun shot. Blood swirling around him. People start to get around. A woman dials 911. CU of Mark’s visibly disturbed face. SMASH TO BLACK: THE END`
