FADE IN

SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE

Silent and endless.  The stars shine like the love of
God...cold and remote.  Against them drifts a tiny chip
of technology.

CLOSER SHOT  It is the Narcissus, lifeboat of the
ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo.  Without interior
or running lights it seems devoid of life.  The PING
of a RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer.  A shadow
engulfs the Narcissus.  Searchlights flash on, playing
over the tiny ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends
toward it.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**INT. NARCISSUS**

Dark and dormant as a crypt. The searchlights stream in the dusty windows. Outside, massive metal forms can BE SEEN descending around the shuttle. Like the tolling of a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through the hull.

CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR Light glares as a cutting torch bursts through the metal. Sparks shower into the room.

A second torch cuts through. They move with machine precision, cutting a rectangular path, converging. The torches meet. Cut off. The door falls inward REVEALING a bizarre multi-armed figure. A ROBOT WELDER.

FIGURES ENTER, backlit and ominous. THREE MEN in bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment. They approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g.

**LEADER**
(filtered)
Internal pressure positive. Assume nominal hull integrity. Hypersleep capsules, style circa late twenties...

His gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the canopy.

ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE as light stabs in where the dust is wiped away, illuminating a **WOMAN**, her face in peaceful repose.

**WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY**, sole survivor of the Nostromo. Nestled next to her is JONES, the ship's wayward cat.

**LEADER**
(voice over; filtered)
Lights are green. She's alive. Well, there goes out salvage, guys.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**MED-TECH**

        She's lying in a bed, looking wan, as a female **MED-TECH**
        raises the backrest.  She is surrounded by arcane white
        MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.  The **Med-Tech** exudes practiced
        cheeriness.

                                   **MED-TECH**
                    Why don't I open the viewport?
                    Watch your eyes.

        Harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into
        the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista.  Beyond the
        sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively
        called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen
        from high orbit.  Blue and serene.

                                   **MED-TECH**
                    And how are we today?

                                   **RIPLEY**
                           (weakly)
                    Terrible.

                                   **MED-TECH**
                    Just terrible?  That's better
                    than yesterday at least.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    How long have I been on
                    Gateway station?

                                   **MED-TECH**
                    Just a couple of days.  Do you
                    feel up to a visitor?

        **RIPLEY** shrugs, not caring.  The door opens and a **MAN**
        enters, although **RIPLEY** sees only what he is carrying.  A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    Jones!

        She grabs the cat like a life preserver.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                           (cooing baby-cat talk)
                    Come here Jonesy you ugly old
                    moose...you ugly thing.

        Jones patiently endures **RIPLEY**'s embarrassing display,
        seeming none the worse for wear.  The visitor sits
        beside the bed and **RIPLEY** finally notices him.  He is
        thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive
        or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness.  A
        smile referred to as "winning."

                                   **MAN**
                    Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke.
                    I work for the company, but other
                    than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to
                    see you're feeling better.  I'm told
                    the weakness and disorientation
                    should pass soon.  Side effects of
                    the unusually long hypersleep, or
                    something like that.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    How long was I out there?  They
                    won't tell me anything.

                                   **BURKE**
                           (soothing)
                    Well, maybe you shouldn't worry
                    about that just yet.

        **RIPLEY** grabs his arm, surprising him.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    How long?

        **BURKE** gazes at her, thoughtful.

                                   **BURKE**
                    All right.  My instinct says
                    you're strong enough to handle
                    this...Fifty-seven years.

        **RIPLEY** is stunned.  She seems to deflate, her expression
        passing through amazement and shock to realization of
        all she has lost.  Friends.  Family.  Her world.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

                                   **BURKE**
                    You'd drifted right through the
                    core systems.  It's blind luck that
                    deep-salvage team caught you when
                    they...are you all right?

        **RIPLEY** coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression
        becomes one of dawning horror.  **BURKE** hands her a glass
        of water from the nightstand.  She slaps it away.  It
        shatters with a SMASH.  Jones dives, yowling.  **RIPLEY**
        grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling.  The **MED-TECH** hits a console button.

                                   **MED-TECH**
                           (shouting)
                    Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!
                    4-1-5!

        **BURKE** and the **MED-TECH** are holding **RIPLEY**'s shoulders as
        she goes into convulsions.  A **DOCTOR** and TWO TECHS run
        in.  **RIPLEY**'s back arches in agony.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    No...noooo!

        They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over
        equipment.  Her EKG races like mad.  Jones, under a
        cabinet, hisses wide-eyed.

                                   **DOCTOR**
                    Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!
                    And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!

        AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath the sheet covering her
        chest!  **RIPLEY** stares at the SHAPE RISING UNDER THE
        SHEET.  Tearing itself out of her.

        HER P.O.V. as the sheet rises.  A GLIMPSE OF the
        CHITTERING HORROR...IT SCREECHES.

        TIGHT ON **RIPLEY**  screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME.
        Alone in the darkened hospital room.  She gasps for
        breath, clutching pathetically at her chest.  There is
        no demented horror rigging itself out of her.  Her eyes
        snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of
        her safety.  Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her
        breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs.

        A VIDEO MONITOR beside the bed snaps on.  A **MED-TECH**'s
        face.

                                   **MED-TECH**
                    Bad dreams again?  Do you want
                    something to help you sleep?

                                   **RIPLEY**
                           (faint)
                    No.. I've slept enough.

        The **MED-TECH** shrugs and switches off.  Touching a button
        on the nightstand she opens the viewport, REVEALING
        Gateway and the turquoise Earth.  She hugs Jones to her
        and rocks with him like a child, still shattered by the
        nightmare.  Shivering.  Sleep is far off.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    We made it, Jones.  We made it.

        But at what price?

                                                        CUT TO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
**EXT. PARK**

Sunlight streams in shafts through a stand of poplars,
beyond which a verdant meadow is VISIBLE.

EXTREME F.G.  Jones stalks toward a bird hopping among
fallen leaves.  He leaps.  And smack into A WALL.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                           (voice over)
                    Dumbshit.

WIDER ANGLE  as Jones steps back confused from the
HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of
cinerama video-loop.  **RIPLEY** sits on a bench in what we
now SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, still
somewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station.  Benches.
Some unenthusiastic potted trees.  The sterile corridors
VISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g.

**BURKE** ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.

                                   **BURKE**
                    Sorry...I've been running behind
                    all morning.

**RIPLEY** seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    Have they located my daughter
                    yet?

                                   **BURKE**
                    Well, I was going to wait
                    until after the inquest...

He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printer
hard copy, including a telestat photo.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    Is she...?

                                   **BURKE**
                           (scanning)
                    Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married
                    name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six
                    ...at time of death.  Two years
                    ago.
                           (looks at her)
                    I'm sorry.

**RIPLEY** studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned.

The face of a woman in her mid-sixties.  It could be
anybody.  She tries to reconcile the face with the
little girl she once knew.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    Amy.

                                   **BURKE**
                           (reading)
                    Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't
                    licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred
                    Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
                    Wisconsin.  No children.

**RIPLEY** gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the
past.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    I promised her I'd be home for
                    her birthday.  Her eleventh
                    birthday.  I sure missed that
                    one.
                           (pause)
                    Well...she has already learned
                    to take my promises with a grain
                    of salt.  When it came to flight
                    schedules, anyway.

**BURKE** nods, a simpatico presence.

                                   **RIPLEY**
                    You always think you can make it
                    up to somebody...later, you know.
                    But now I never can.  I never
                    can.

Let's get one thing straight...**RIPLEY** can be one tough
lady.  But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in
this moment, overwhelming.  She cries silently.

**BURKE** puts a reassuring hand on her arm.

                                   **BURKE**
                           (gently)
                   The hearing convenes at 0930.  You
                   don't want to be late.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**INT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY**

Elevator doors part and **RIPLEY** emerges, in mid-conversation
with **BURKE**. DOLLYING AHEAD OF THEM as they move rapidly
down the corridor.

**RIPLEY**
You read my deposition...it's
complete and accurate.

**BURKE**
Look, I believe you, but there are
going to be some heavyweights in
there. You got Feds, you got
interstellar commerce commission,
you got colonial administration,
insurance company guys...

**RIPLEY**
I get the picture.

**BURKE**
Just tell them what happened. The
important thing is to stay cool
and unemotional.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
